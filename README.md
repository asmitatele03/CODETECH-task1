overview of the project

project :CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS

Understanding the Data:
In this project, I performed customer segmentation and analysis on a retail dataset to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior.
The primary objective was to gain insights into customer patterns and develop targeted marketing strategies.

Data Understanding and Preprocessing:
Data Collection: The dataset included customer IDs, purchase history, frequency of purchases, and monetary values.
Data Cleaning: I handled missing values, outliers, and ensured the data was consistent and ready for analysis.
Feature Engineering: I derived key features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to capture important aspects of customer behavior.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships between features. Visualizations like histograms and scatter plots were used to explore the data.
Clustering and Segmentation:

K-Means Clustering: I implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method,
where I plotted the Elbow Graph to identify the point where adding more clusters did not significantly improve the variance explained.
Centroid Analysis: After determining the optimal number of clusters, I plotted the Centroid Graph to visualize the centers of each cluster,
which represent the average customer profile for each segment.

Segment Analysis:
I analyzed the characteristics of each segment by looking at the average RFM values within each cluster. This helped identify high-value customers,
frequent buyers, and other distinct customer groups.
Visualizations were used to illustrate the differences between segments, making it easier to interpret the results.

Insights and Recommendations:
Based on the segmentation, I provided actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies. For example,
I recommended focusing on loyalty programs for high-value segments and promotional offers for less frequent buyers.

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, allowing for more personalized and effective marketing strategies.
The use of clustering techniques and visualizations like the Elbow and Centroid Graphs were crucial in deriving meaningful insights from the data.
